**Binary to DNA Sequence Encoder and Decoder**

📌Project Description

This project provides Python functions to convert any binary string into a DNA sequence and back. It uses a simple 2-bit to nucleotide encoding scheme, representing digital data as DNA bases (A, C, G, T). This tool serves as a foundational piece for DNA digital data storage research, bioinformatics, or educational purposes.

⚙️Features

    Encode binary data into DNA sequences

    Decode DNA sequences back into binary

    Easy-to-use Python functions with clear mapping rules

    Validates input for consistent encoding and decoding

📊Usage

Use binary_to_dna(binary_string) to encode and dna_to_binary(dna_sequence) to decode. An example is included in the code demonstrating round-trip conversion.
