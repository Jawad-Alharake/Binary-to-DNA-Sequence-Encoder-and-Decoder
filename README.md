**Binary to DNA Sequence Encoder and Decoder**

📌Project Description

This repository provides Python tools for encoding binary data into DNA sequences and decoding them back, supporting multiple encoding schemes:
- **Simple 2-bit encoding:** Maps every 2 binary bits directly to a single DNA base (A, C, G, T).
- **Advanced 5-bit chunk encoding:** Converts 5-bit binary chunks into DNA triplets, supporting more efficient and biologically meaningful encodings.

This tool serves as a foundational piece for DNA digital data storage research, bioinformatics, or educational purposes.

⚙️Features

    Encode binary data into DNA sequences

    Decode DNA sequences back into binary

    Easy-to-use Python functions with clear mapping rules

    Validates input for consistent encoding and decoding

📊Usage

Run the script in a Python environment or Jupyter notebook:

- Enter any binary string (any length).
- Choose if you want detailed step-by-step explanations.
- The script outputs encoded DNA sequence and verifies decoding.
